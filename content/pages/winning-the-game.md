To win Businessaire, a player must be the first to reach a predetermined net worth amount, usually $200,000.

Players gain net worth in a few key ways:

### Brick & Mortar Businesses

Purchasing Brick & Mortar businesses from the Business List grants their listed net worth value. 

For example:

- **Gym & Fitness Center** - Grants 75K in net worth when purchased.

- **Boutique & Clothing Store** - Grants 50K in net worth when purchased.

### Cash 

Having cash on hand also counts towards net worth, up to 20K maximum.

This includes:

- Starting cash and payments
- Cash from selling Products, checks, etc.
- Loans taken from the bank

### Liquidating Businesses

Selling off Business chips/cards provides additional cash to raise net worth.

For example: 

- **Sell Gym & Fitness Center** - Regain 75K business value as cash when sold off.

- **Sell Snowball Stand** - Regain purchase price as cash when sold.

First player to reach the target net worth wins!
