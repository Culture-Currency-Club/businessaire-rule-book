On a player's turn, they must move their game piece around the board following these rules:

1. ### Starting Position

   All players start with their game pieces in the center "Corporate America" space. On their first turn, players must move their piece down one of the 8 colored columns (called Districts) radiating out from the center.

2. ### Roll Dice

   To move, a player rolls both dice and can choose to move:

   - The number of spaces shown on die 1
   - The number of spaces shown on die 2
   - The total number of spaces from adding both dice

   For example, if a player rolls a 3 and 4, they could move 3, 4, or 7 spaces total.

3. ### Subway

   Each District has a Subway space. If a player lands on a Subway space, they can play their Subway Pass card to transport to any other Subway space on the board. This counts as 1 move. If they don't have a Pass, they can buy one for $500 and continue their turn.
   
4. ### Pay to Move

   Instead of rolling, a player can pay $500 per space to move up to 3 spaces in any direction. This must be decided before rolling.

5. ### Quick Businesses

   Until all 8 Quick Business spaces are owned, a player can move directly to an unowned Quick Business space to purchase it. This is the only case where exact count movement is allowed.

6. ### Movement Rules

   Other movement rules:

   - Cannot move diagonally or count the same space twice
   - Direction can be changed during the move  
   - Must move down a column when starting or in the center space
