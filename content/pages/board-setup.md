# Board Setup

## Setup

To set up Businessaire, follow these steps:

1. ### Game Board

   Place the game board in the center of the playing area. Orient it so the BUSINESSAIRE street sign in the middle points upright. This positions the 8 districts radiating outwards correctly.

2. ### Game Decks

   Separate all card decks and place each pile face down in its marked hexagonal space around the board perimeter:

   - Business List deck - bottom left
   - Articles of Organization deck - bottom right  
   - Business Venture deck - left side
   - Street Risk deck - right side
   - Product deck - top left
   - Business Savvy deck - top right
   - Quick Business/Doubles deck - top middle

3. ### Cash Reserves 

   Place all paper money in organized piles as follows:

   - Checks - bottom left hexagon
   - $500 bills - bottom left hexagon
   - $1000 bills - bottom right hexagon
   - $5000 bills - bottom right hexagon   

4. ### Game Pieces

   Each player selects a colored game piece and places it in the center CORPORATE AMERICA space of the board.

5. ### Player Assets

   Give each player the following starting assets:

   - Cash = $10,000 total
     - 4 x $500 bills
     - 3 x $1000 bills
     - 1 x $5000 bill
   - 1 Business List card
   - 1 Business Savvy Point cube
   - 1 Business Savvy Point tracker card

6. ### Dice & Product Die

   Place both red dice and the special Product Die in the center of the board.

Once complete, the game is ready to begin! First turn order is set clockwise from the GREEN District.
