On a player's turn, they must move their game piece around the board following these rules:

1. ### Starting Off

-   All players start with their game piece in the center Corporate America space.
    
-   The first player is chosen based on the orientation of the board:
    
    -   The green Businessaire street sign in the center indicates the orientation.
    -   With the sign upright, North is the Purple District and South is the Orange District.
-   Turn order proceeds clockwise from the starting player based on the pieces' positions.
    
-   On your first turn, you must move your piece down one of the 8 colored columns (Districts) radiating out from the center space.
    
-   You can choose which District column to start in. Common choices:
    
    -   Move down the district you have a Quick Business in
    -   Move down a district you need a space from for your strategy
    -   Move down the district that has the most unowned businesses
-   Once all players have moved from the center, gameplay proceeds with players taking turns rolling dice and moving around the board.
    

The card decks and money should already be set up around the board before starting off. Players choose their piece and the banker is chosen randomly. Then the starting orientation is set and players take their first move!

2. ### Roll Dice

   To move, a player rolls both dice and can choose to move:

   - The number of spaces shown on die 1
   - The number of spaces shown on die 2
   - The total number of spaces from adding both dice

   For example, if a player rolls a 3 and 4, they could move 3, 4, or 7 spaces total.

3. ### Subway

   Each District has a Subway space. If a player lands on a Subway space, they can play their Subway Pass card to transport to any other Subway space on the board. This counts as 1 move. If they don't have a Pass, they can buy one for $500 and continue their turn.
   
4. ### Pay to Move

   Instead of rolling, a player can pay $500 per space to move up to 3 spaces in any direction. This must be decided before rolling.

5. ### Quick Businesses

   Until all 8 Quick Business spaces are owned, a player can move directly to an unowned Quick Business space to purchase it. This is the only case where exact count movement is allowed.

6. ### Movement Rules

   Other movement rules:

   - Cannot move diagonally or count the same space twice
   - Direction can be changed during the move  
   - Must move down a column when starting or in the center space
